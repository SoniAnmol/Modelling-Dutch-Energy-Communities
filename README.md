## General information

This project is a thesis project done in collaboration with [Croonwolter&Dros](https://croonwolterendros.nl/). This
model is primary focused on electric energy communities and can be extended to other energy sources. The model is used
to evaluate demand response with in energy communities while ensuring fair distribution of cost and benefits among
community members.

## Current state

This model is currently in development. This document will be updated shortly.

## Model

### TODOs

* [ ] Create archetypes for community configurations
* [ ] Implement energy storage/battery

#### Agents conceptualisation

`Coordinator`:
This agent is responsible for following tasks in the energy community.

1. balance_supply_demand
2. release_tod_schedule
3. distribute_costs_and_benefits
