## General information

This project is a thesis project done in collaboration with [Croonwolter&Dros](https://croonwolterendros.nl/). This
model is primary focused on electric energy communities and can be extended to other energy sources. The model is used
to evaluate demand response with in energy communities while ensuring fair distribution of cost and benefits among
community members.

A thesis committee has been set up to evaluate the model and end results.

## Current state

This model is currently in development. This is the initial commit of the model.

## Introduction

## Model

### Conceptualisation

This is the initial conceptualisation of the model. This project is still in development and the conceptualisation is
not yet complete/finalised.

#### Model conceptualisation

This model is based on a proposed energy community in Hazeldonk, Breda. In this model, community members are agents and
the energy community is the environment. Time step of the model is 1 day and the model runs for 30 steps (period of 1
month).

#### Agents conceptualisation

`Coordinator`:
This agent is responsible for following tasks in the energy community.
1. assessing the current state of the energy community and making investment decisions
2. balance_supply_demand
3. release_tod_schedule
4. distribute_costs_and_benefits

Assessment of community requirement:
The model is run for 30 steps (period of 1 month) with existing assets of energy community.
Based on the results of previous runs, Coordinator will assess the average energy deficit or surplus.
If energy is deficit, Coordinator will set up a generation asset.
If energy is surplus, Coordinator will set up a storage asset.

`set_up_generation_asset`:
If energy is deficit, Coordinator will set up a generation asset.
Coordinator will determine the size of the asset based on the energy deficit using following formula:

(Daily kWh รท average sun hours) x efficiency_factor = solar system size
The efficiency factor is based on the average efficiency of the solar system.

kWh = 0.01328 x (rotor diameter (feet)))^2 x (average wind speed (mph))^3

Source: NREL

`set_up_storage_asset`:
If energy is surplus, Coordinator will set up a storage asset. Coordinator will determine the size of the asset based on
the energy surplus using following formula:

battery size = Daily kWh x (1 + DoD)
DoD: Depth of Discharge (percentage)

All the batteries in the model have respective depletion factors after each charge discharge cycle. After complete
depletion, the battery will be replaced and additional cost will be added for the community. Battery in the model is
designed for one day back-up. This will result in smaller battery size which can be easily replaced after depletion.

Assumptions:
1. efficiency_factor considered for system size is assumed to be constant across brands and systems.
2. Average solar peak hours and average wind speed is also assumed to be constant for simplicity.

##### Fair investment opportunities for the energy community members

After finalising the asset type and size, Coordinator will ask interested members to invest in the asset. Not all the
interested members will be able to invest in the asset and some of them will be left out. This will be done by
introducing a random opportunity of investment factor. The filtered interested members will be asked to invest in the
asset. The investment by each member is capped so that commercial parties do not buy the major equity share of the
asset.

Assumptions: 
1. Non-residential energy community members are always interested in investing the asset.
2. Residential member's investment capacity is limited and function of annual household income.
3. Higher equity share in the community asset will result in higher influence in decision-making.

**`Member`**:
This agent represents a member of the community. A `Member` can make following actions:

- `invest`: invest in the community asset (e.g. solar panels, storage, etc.) at the start of simulation
- `comply_tod`: Comply with the time of day schedule released by community coordinator.

`Member` can be of following types:

1. `Residential`: A member of the community that is a resident (household).
2. `Commercial`: A member of the community that is a commercial building (office/SME).
3. `Utility`: A member of the community that is a utility (Streetlights, elevator, etc.).
4. `School`: A member of the community that is a school.
5. `EVChargingStation`: A member of the community that is a charging station for electric vehicles.

All `Member` have the following attributes:

- **Demand**: A community `Member` has three demand attributes:
   1. day_ahead_demand: The demand profile of the member for the next day.
   2. demand_schedule: The demand profile of the member for current day.
   3. demand_realised: The actualised demand profile of the member for current day.

Assumptions:
1. Number of members remains constant during the model run. 
2. It is assumed that the demand profile of each member is constant throughout the simulation.
